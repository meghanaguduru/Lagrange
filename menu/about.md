title: About
---
I am pursuing a Masters in ECE at Carnegie Mellon University. My interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision and Deep learning. At CMU, I am working on developing robust shadow detection techniques to aid accurate pedestrian tracking in NavLab, Robotics Institute. More recently, I have developed great interest in the applications of Computer Vision in Augmented/Virtual Reality

In 2014, I graduated with a Bachelors of Technology from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. After that, I worked for a couple of years at Qualcomm with the GPU team before deciding to pursue my Masters degree.
