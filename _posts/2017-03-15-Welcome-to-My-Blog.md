This is my personal blog. The purpose of this blog is to share thoughts about things I find interesting or thought-provoking while I study.

### About me : Interests

I really enjoy learning new things. Things both relevant and things completely irrelevant (mostly tech stuff though). 

Technology is my passion. 

I have always been a very visual person. This interest of mine saw me through learning art, design, image processing, UI/frontend design, data visualization and finally computer vision.
